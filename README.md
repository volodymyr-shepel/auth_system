# Project Title:
Microservices-Based User Registration and Authentication System with Email Account Confirmation

## Project Description
This project presents the development and implementation of a robust user registration and authentication system designed around microservices architecture. The core security mechanism utilized in this system is the use of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to ensure secure and efficient user interactions. Additionally, to enhance the overall application performance and user experience, RabbitMQ message queuing has been integrated.

## Key Features
- **User Registration:** Users can create accounts securely by providing essential information.
- **Email Account Confirmation:** A crucial layer of security is ensured through email-based account confirmation, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
- **Microservices Architecture:** The application is built using microservices, allowing for modularity, scalability, and easier maintenance.
- **JWT Token Security:** JSON Web Tokens are employed for secure and efficient user authentication and authorization.
- **RabbitMQ Integration:** RabbitMQ message queuing enhances application efficiency by enabling asynchronous communication between microservices.
- **Testing with JUnit5 and Mockito:** Rigorous testing using JUnit5 and Mockito ensures the reliability and stability of the application.

## Project Objectives
- Develop a highly secure and scalable user registration and authentication system.
- Implement email account confirmation to verify user identities.
- Utilize microservices for modularity and scalability.
- Enhance security and efficiency through JWT token authentication.
- Improve application responsiveness with RabbitMQ message queuing.
- Ensure the reliability of the application through comprehensive testing using JUnit5 and Mockito.

## Benefits
- **Enhanced Security:** Protect user accounts through email confirmation and JWT token security.
- **Scalability:** Microservices architecture facilitates scalability as the user base grows.
- **Improved User Experience:** Asynchronous communication via RabbitMQ enhances user experience by reducing latency.
- **Reliability:** Extensive testing ensures the application's stability and robustness.

## Conclusion
The Microservices-Based User Registration and Authentication System with Email Account Confirmation is a robust and secure solution designed to provide users with a seamless registration and authentication experience. By utilizing microservices, JWT token security, RabbitMQ messaging, and comprehensive testing, the application aims to meet the highest standards of security, scalability, and reliability.
